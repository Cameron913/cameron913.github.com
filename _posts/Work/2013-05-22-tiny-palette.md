Tiny Palette is an itty bitty bookmarklet for keeping a palette of colors in localStorage (per website) for quick reference. You can try it out by clicking <a href="javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.body.appendChild(document.createElement(%27script%27)).src%3D%27http://host.camerongarrett.com/Tiny-Palette/tiny-palette.js%27%3B%7D)()%3B">here</a> (it will appear at the top of your browser window).

1. Click the plus sign to add a color by hex code.
2. Drag the widget around your page by the textured bar.
3. Reorder swatches by dragging them.
4. Click the little minus sign in the bottom corner of a swatch to remove it.
5. Click on the hex color that shows up on hover to copy or change it.

The code for Tiny Palette can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cameron913/Tiny-Palette).

Note: I just found a bug that prevents the dragging functionality from working in Firefox, currently working on a fix.
